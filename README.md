# grootbot
IRC bot representing the latest AI model of Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy.

# to run
Clone the repo, copy bot.cfg.example to bot.cfg and edit it to change password, server, channels, owner, etc. Run with `./start.sh` (command line options are the same as the basic kitnirc skeleton). You can ^c to stop tailing the log.

# worth mentioning
The bot uses a modified version of the admintools module, to keep it from breaking character. Make sure you include this one, not the standard kitn one, unless it's out of date and you don't care about that.
